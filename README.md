This is a simple web-based attendance summary tool to calculate and display attendance details for a semester course. It shows total classes, classes conducted, classes attended, and how many classes you need to attend to maintain a 75% attendance requirement. It also provides advice on whether you need to attend more classes or can afford to skip some.
